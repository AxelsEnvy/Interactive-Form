- I was having an issue where when I created a repo in Github, I could not find my project files anywhere. So, I decided to work on the project in its entirety first, then figure out the issue with Github afterwards. I have completed Project 3 now, and have finally figured out how to solve the problem I was having with Github.
- Added the jquery library to the project files, and had them hooked up to the index.html file.
- Added an input element for 'other-title'. I don't know how I forgot to add it before.
